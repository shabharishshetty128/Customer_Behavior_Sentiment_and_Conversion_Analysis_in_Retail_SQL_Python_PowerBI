## Findings and Analysis
Denomination and Year-wise Insights (2015-2025)

 - From FY2014–15 to FY2024–25, counterfeit currency circulation shows a major spike in FY2016–17, with over 7.6 lakh fake notes worth ₹43 crore seized, largely driven by forged ₹500 and ₹1000 notes prior to demonetization.
 - Demonetization caused a sharp short-term decline, but counterfeiters quickly adapted, shifting focus to ₹200 and ₹2000 denominations.
 - Fake ₹2000 notes increased steadily until FY2023–24, followed by a sharp drop in FY2024–25 after the withdrawal of the denomination.
 - ₹100 notes consistently remained among the most counterfeited, due to their high circulation and lower public scrutiny, while lower denominations showed minimal forgery.

Regional & State-wise Insights (2016–2022)

 - Gujarat recorded the highest seizure value (₹355.16 crore), significantly higher than all other states.
 - National counterfeit seizures spiked in 2022, reaching ₹3,826 crore, accounting for nearly 65% of the total seizures during the period.
 - The 2022 spike was largely driven by Gujarat, likely due to strong enforcement actions or the busting of a major counterfeit network.
 - Maharashtra, Delhi, Karnataka, and West Bengal consistently ranked among the top counterfeit-prone states.
 - Delhi reported over ₹37 crore in seizures, reflecting its importance as a high-cash, high-transaction circulation hub.
 - Counterfeit activity was concentrated in economically active and border states such as West Bengal, Punjab, and Assam, indicating possible cross-border smuggling routes.
 - Smaller states and Union Territories showed minimal seizure values, suggesting lower penetration or limited circulation.

## Recommendations
 - Enhance currency security features, especially for high-use notes like ₹100 and ₹500.
 - Increase public awareness on identifying fake notes using visible security markers.
 - Strengthen border surveillance in high-risk states such as West Bengal, Punjab, and Assam.
 - Improve inter-agency coordination between RBI, banks, and law enforcement agencies.
 - Set up specialized anti-counterfeit units in states with high FICN activity.
 - Upgrade bank detection systems with advanced scanning and sorting technologies.
 - Expand the dataset to include newer banknotes and diverse counterfeit patterns.

## Limitations
 - Analysis limited to a fictional data and not based on real data.
 - Sentiment classification depends on review text data quality.
 - External market factors not included in the model.
 - Findings will vary with real-time data.
